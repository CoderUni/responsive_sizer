## Usage

Import the Package: 
```
import 'package:responsive_sizer/responsive_sizer.dart';
```

Wrap MaterialApp with ResponsiveSizer widget:
```
ResponsiveSizer(
  child: MaterialApp()
)
```

**Widget Size**
```
    Container(
      width: 20.w,    // This will take 20% of the screen's width
      height: 30.5.h     // This will take 30.5% of the screen's height
    )
```

**Font size**
```
    Text(
      'Sizer', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 15.sp),
    );
```

**Orientation**

If you want to support both portrait and landscape orientations
```
Device.orientation == Orientation.portrait
  ? Container(   // Widget for Portrait
      width: 100.w,
      height: 20.5.h,
   )
  : Container(   // Widget for Landscape
      width: 100.w,
      height: 12.5.h,
   )
```

**DeviceType** ðŸ“±

If you want the same layout to look different in tablet and mobile then use ``Device.screenType`` method
```
Device.screenType
```

You can use it like this:
```
Device.screenType == ScreenType.tablet
  ? Container(   // Widget for Tablet
      width: 100.w,
      height: 20.5.h,
   )
  : Container(   // Widget for Mobile
      width: 100.w,
      height: 12.5.h,
   )
```

## Take Note

**You need to import `responsive_sizer` package in order to access number.h or number.w**

**Auto import in VSCode and Android Studio doesn't work for dart extensions.** Eg: Typing 10.h would not bring up auto import suggestion for this package

One workaround is to type `Device` so that the auto import suggestion for this package would show up:
```
import 'package:responsive_sizer/responsive_sizer.dart';
```
